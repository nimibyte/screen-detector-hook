# `useScreenDetector` Hook

## Overview

`useScreenDetector` is a custom React hook that helps you determine the current screen size and orientation (landscape or portrait) based on predefined breakpoints. It is designed to be used for responsive web development, where you need to handle different screen sizes like mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The hook allows you to dynamically adjust UI elements based on the screen size and orientation.
