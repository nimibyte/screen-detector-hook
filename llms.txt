Primary intent: React hook for runtime breakpoint and orientation detection.

Best for:
- Determining current `mobile`/`tablet`/`desktop` screen class in React components
- Reacting to viewport orientation changes (`landscape`)
- Driving responsive rendering logic from JavaScript/TypeScript

Core API:
- useScreenDetector(params)
- UseScreenDetectorParams
- Screen

Read first:
- README.md
- README.ai.md

Integration notes:
- Import `useScreenDetector` from `@nimibyte/screen-detector-hook`
- Provide at least one breakpoint in `breakpoints`
- Use `detector: true` to update on window resize
- Read `screen` and `landscape` from the hook return value

Non-goals:
- CSS media query replacement for styling-only cases
- Non-React runtime support
- Advanced matchMedia query management toolkit
